# Nether Pathfinder
High performance path finder for Minecraft's nether dimension, useful for travelling by elytra.

This repo is the core implementation of the path finder but is not useful on its own. See [nether-pathfinder-mod](https://github.com/babbaj/nether-pathfinder-mod) for integration inside of a forge mod.
